# Reading-Writing

Years ago, when I wasn't as aware of my reading style, I'd pick up books that others recommended.
I'd move along with different types of literature, figuring out what resonated with me. 
I'd often start reading with passion – bestsellers and such, only to lose interest midway. 
For a long time, I thought reading wasn't for me. Over time, I realized that maybe writers are 
inherently speakers or listeners. Speakers have the vocabulary and storyline designed before they 
lift a pen. Listeners wait for the right words to be revealed to them, and then these words tell them 
the stories that want to be told. 

I am more of a listener than a speaker,

Perhaps because <br /> 
I had to wait as well  <br /> 
to listen to my style of words  <br /> 
words that craft stories  <br /> 
words that speak life to your soul  <br /> 

words that give you content  <br /> 
yet so fill you with longing  <br /> 
mysteries of the said and the unsaid  <br /> 
and right there in the in-between  <br /> 
you hear your rhythm  <br /> 
and find your alignment!  <br /> 

### Here I collect some words that have resonated with me
___
**The Road to Mecca,** Muhammad Asad

- "We allow ourselves to be blown by the winds because we do know what we want: our hearts know it, 
even if our thoughts are sometimes slow to follow- but in the end, they do catch up with our hearts 
and then we think we have made a decision."
- “Whatever beauty man may be able to create with his hands, it will be only conceit to deem it worthy 
of God; therefore, the simplest that man can conceive is the greatest that he can do to express the glory of God.”

**Crime and Punishment,** Fyodor Dostoyevsky
- “We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.”

**The Secret Life of Bees,** Sue Monk Kidd
- “I have noticed that if you look carefully at people’s eyes the first five seconds they look at you, the truth of their feelings will shine through for just an instant before it flickers away.”
