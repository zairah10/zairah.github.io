<p>Hey there! I am a Data Scientist at IBM.</p>

<p>Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master’s in Computer Science. 
I was advised by <a href="http://jasonhmoore.org/">Jason Moore</a> at The Computational Genetics Lab where I worked
on <a href="https://github.com/rhiever/sklearn-benchmarks">benchmarking the scikit-learn machine learning library</a> in Python.</p>

<p>Find me on LinkedIn.</p>

<h2 id="some-more-about-me">Some more about me</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Kashmir. It’s a ~70K sq mile land in the Northern Himalayas bordering South and Central Asia. 
Kashmir has a very long history of colonialism. Often it’s labeled as “too complicated” for a peaceful resolution. But the tragic reality is as simple as it can get for those who understand. 
<br /></p>

<p>I left Kashmir many years back to pursue higher education. I miss it every day. 
<br /></p>

<p>I love to travel and sit in cafes. I often venture into adventure sports. I believe travel opens unimaginable new doors and expands one’s horizons by exposure to diverse cultures, landscapes, and people that are so inspiring.
<br /></p>

<p>I am an avid reader of history, literature, and some philosophy. 
<br /></p>

<p>I mostly rely on independent resources and people’s lived experiences for history. The ones that challenge the status quo and help break the institutional narratives that we’re conditioned to believe. 
<br /></p>

<p>I often contemplate the nature and meaning of time. Is time an illusion? How are memory and time connected? 
<a href="https://youtu.be/zrFzSwHxiBQ">Does time flow both ways</a>?
To this end, I’ve read <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/">The Philosophy of Time</a> and 
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/">The Experience and Perception of Time</a> 
word to word several times. I don’t yet know where I’m going with all this. I guess “time” will tell. 
<br /></p>

<p>I sometimes collect what I read <a href="https://zairahms.github.io/Reading-Writing">here</a>. 
<br /></p>

<p>Having multiple hobbies and interests can feel overwhelming. 
<br /></p>

<p>Ironically, the wide variety of things that I’ve read, my experiences, combined with my inner monologue, have given me a sense of unification. 
It’s what’s opened me to the world of Sacred Geometry. I find harmony in observing the shapes and patterns found in the world around us. 
I think they reflect the underlying order of the universe - embodying Oneness with all of life.</p>
