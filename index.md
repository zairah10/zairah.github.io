# Zairah Mustahsan
Hey there! I am a Data Scientist at IBM. 

Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's in Computer Science. 
I was advised by [Jason Moore](http://jasonhmoore.org/) at The Computational Genetics Lab where I worked
on [benchmarking the scikit-learn machine learning library](https://github.com/rhiever/sklearn-benchmarks) in Python.

Find me on LinkedIn.


## Some more about me

I was born and raised in Kashmir. It's a ~70K sq mile land in the Northern Himalayas bordering South and Central Asia. 
Kashmir has a very long history of colonialism. Often it's labeled as "too complicated" for a peaceful resolution. But the tragic reality is as simple as it can get for those who understand. 
<br /> 

I left Kashmir many years back to pursue higher education. I miss it every day. 
<br /> 

I love to travel and sit in cafes. I often venture into adventure sports. I believe travel opens unimaginable new doors and expands one's horizons by exposure to diverse cultures, landscapes, and people that are so inspiring.
<br /> 

I am an avid reader of history, literature, and some philosophy. 
<br /> 

I mostly rely on independent resources and people's lived experiences for history. The ones that challenge the status quo and help break the institutional narratives that we're conditioned to believe. 
<br /> 

I often contemplate the nature and meaning of time. Is time an illusion? How are memory and time connected? 
[Does time flow both ways](https://youtu.be/zrFzSwHxiBQ)?
To this end, I've read [The Philosophy of Time](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/) and 
[The Experience and Perception of Time](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/) 
word to word several times. I don't yet know where I'm going with all this. I guess "time" will tell. 
<br /> 

I sometimes collect what I read [here](https://zairahms.github.io/Reading-Writing). 
<br /> 

Having multiple hobbies and interests can feel overwhelming. 
<br /> 

Ironically, the wide variety of things that I've read, my experiences, combined with my inner monologue, have given me a sense of unification. 
It's what's opened me to the world of Sacred Geometry. I find harmony in observing the shapes and patterns found in the world around us. 
I think they reflect the underlying order of the universe - embodying Oneness with all of life.
