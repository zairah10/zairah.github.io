# Zairah Mustahsan

Hey there! I am a Data Scientist at IBM. 

Previously, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's in Computer Science. 
I was advised by [Jason Moore](http://jasonhmoore.org/) at The Computational Genetics Lab where I worked
on [benchmarking the scikit-learn machine learning library](https://github.com/rhiever/sklearn-benchmarks) in Python.

Find me on LinkedIn.


## About me

I grew up in Kashmir, a place in northern Himalayas. I moved to the US in 2015 for my graduate studies.
